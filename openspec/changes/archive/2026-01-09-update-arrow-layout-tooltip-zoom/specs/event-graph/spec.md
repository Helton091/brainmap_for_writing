## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Clear arrow direction
The system SHALL render directed edges with a clearly visible arrowhead indicating direction.

#### Scenario: Edge direction is unambiguous
- **WHEN** an edge is displayed on the canvas
- **THEN** the arrowhead SHALL make the source-to-target direction visually obvious

### Requirement: Compact default vertical spacing
The system SHALL generate an initial layout with limited vertical dispersion so that nodes appear roughly aligned.

#### Scenario: Nodes have compact y distribution
- **WHEN** nodes are generated by import and auto layout is applied
- **THEN** the y-coordinates of nodes SHALL fall within a limited band rather than spreading widely

### Requirement: Readable tooltip
The system SHALL display node text in a larger, readable tooltip, and the tooltip box SHALL be approximately square.

#### Scenario: Tooltip uses larger font
- **WHEN** the user hovers a node
- **THEN** the tooltip text SHALL use a larger font than the default UI text

#### Scenario: Tooltip box is compact
- **WHEN** the tooltip is displayed
- **THEN** the tooltip content SHALL be wrapped so the tooltip is not overly wide

### Requirement: Zoomable canvas
The system SHALL allow the user to zoom in and out of the canvas.

#### Scenario: Zoom with input gesture
- **WHEN** the user performs the zoom gesture
- **THEN** the view SHALL zoom in or out while keeping the canvas content usable
